<h1>The Best Books According to Danny</h1>
<h2>My top 3 books of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>To Kill a Mockingbird</h3>
<p>Fairly short cosy read that contains plenty of life lessons.<br />
Atticus Finch is also one of the best literary characters ever written</p>
<h3>IT</h3>
<p>A long chilling read but despite it being a horror book, the books best quality is its coming of age tale.</p>
<h3>Pet Semetery</h3>
<p>A unsettling read that isnt scary in the normal sense. Deals really well with the idea of grief and the things we would do to bring out loved ones back if we could. Even at the cost of them not being quite themselves.</p>
